# A combined fit of the Higgs Branching Ratios at ILD

## Abstract

Given the clean environment at a lepton collider, it is possible to build a sample with Higgs boson events from all decay modes.
The sample can be partitioned into categories that are motivated by the expected Higgs decay modes.
The counts per category are used in a fit to extract the Higgs branching ratios in a model independent fashion.
The results of the fit are directly the branching ratios, independent of a measurement of a Higgs production mode.
In this talk, we present the current status of our implementation of this analysis for the ILD detector concept.
