\begin{abstract}
Higgs decay branching ratios at a future Higgs factories
can be measured by directly exploiting class numeration.
Given the clean environment at a lepton collider,
it is possible to build an event sample highly enriched in Higgs bosons
and essentially unbiased for any decay mode.
The sample can be partitioned into categories using event properties
linked to the expected Higgs decay modes.
The counts per category are used to fit
the Higgs branching ratios in a model independent way.
The result of the fit is directly the set of branching ratios,
independent from any measurement of a Higgs production mode.

We present a simplified study on simulated data
for the International Linear Detector (ILD)
at the International Linear Collider (ILC) at 250~\GeV.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
A Higgs factory will produce a large number of Higgs bosons
in the comparatively simple collision environment of a lepton collider.
The projected gain on the precision of measurements of the particle's parameters
will make these measurements sensitive to deviations
that are predicted by theories of physics beyond the Standard Model.
Multiple proposals exist for Higgs factories operating at a center-of-mass energy
close to the peak of the Higgsstrahlung production cross section,
$\sqrt{s}\approx250~\GeV$.

With the Higgsstrahlung process at a Higgs factory
it is possible to construct an unbiased sample
in which each type of Higgs decay occurs with the probability given by
its branching ratio realized in nature~\cite{HiggsBR_LCWS2019}.
Higgsstrahlung events with $Z \to e^+e^-$ ($e e H$)
and $Z \to \mu^+ \mu^-$ ($\mu \mu H$) can be selected through
the Z boson, independent of the Higgs decay \cite{hRecoilIndependence}.

Figure~\ref{fig:toys} (left) shows how such a sample can be partitioned
into a number of boxes with each of the box selection efficiencies depending
on the specific Higgs decay mode.
The relative frequency of the number of events per box
depends on the Higgs branching ratios.
An inclusive estimation of all branching ratios can be obtained
through a fit on the box counts.
The approach naturally lends itself to an extension with additional boxes
which target a beyond Standard Model Higgs decay.
Additional decay modes can thus be excluded
with an upper limit related to the sample size.

The study is realized in the context of the
International Linear Detector (ILD)~\cite{ILD_DBD,ILD_IDR}.
The ILD detector concept is proposed for the International Linear Collider (ILC).
The detector design is based on the particle flow approach
for particle reconstruction~\cite{ParticleFlow}.
Only running scenarios of the ILC
with a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=250~\GeV$ (ILC250)
are considered here.

The fit is in a preliminary state.
The simulation procedure is described in section~\ref{sec:simulation}.
This includes a summary of the
current simplifications in~\ref{subsec:simplifications}.
First results, with some known shortcomings, are already available.
They are given in section~\ref{sec:fit}.
An outline of the necessary future work is presented
in section~\ref{sec:future_work}.
Finally, the note is summarized in section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.

\section{Simulation}\label{sec:simulation}
We use samples produced by the ILD concept group since 2020.
They are obtained from a detailed simulation of the ILC250
with the SetA beam parameters.

The events are generated at leading order using
WHIZARD version 2.8.5~\cite{whizard,omega}.
Initial State Radiation, Beamstrahlung and Final State Radiation are included.
The fragmentation and hadronization of final-state quarks and gluons
is performed with PYTHIA 6.422~\cite{pythia}.
The ILD detector geometry is described with DD4hep~\cite{DD4hep}
and simulated in GEANT4~\cite{GEANT4}.
Event reconstruction is performed with ILCSoft v02-02~\cite{ILCSoft},
which includes PandoraPFA~\cite{PandoraPFA} for
the construction of particle flow objects
and LCFIPlus~\cite{LCFIPlus} for flavor tagging.

\subsection{Current simplifications}\label{subsec:simplifications}
Results shown here are obtained without considering background processes.
As signal channel, $\nu \bar{\nu} H$ is used without a pre-selection step.
While it is not a realistic scenario,
this pure-Higgs sample can provide a first idea
of the precision and adaptability of the method.

For each of the nine considered main branching ratios of the Higgs boson,
at least 400k simulated events are used.
They are separately weighted and combined into a single sample
with exactly 40k signal Higgs events.
Different Higgs branching ratio scenarios are set through changing the weights.

Note that 40k Higgs events corresponds to about 10\% of the Higgs bosons
produced in the long-running H-20 scenario of the ILC250.
Even before selection inefficiencies, $\mu \mu H$ and $e e H$ account for
less than 7\% of the produced Higgs bosons.
It is mentioned in section \ref{sec:future_work}
that we expect to be able to leverage the $\nu \bar{\nu} H$ sample.
Future work will have to show if the 10\% sample size
is a good estimation of this effect.

\section{Branching ratio uncertainties}\label{sec:fit}
For each Higgs decay mode, a probability vector is
constructed from the simulation.
This vector stores the selection efficiency and the probability
for the events from the chosen type to fall into each of the boxes
that are constructed within the sample.
The vectors can be collected as columns into a probability matrix $M$.
% The expected background counts per box have to be calculated as well.

A statistically independent sample (MC2) is used in place of
the data counts per box.
To test the adaptability of the fit, the Higgs branching ratios in MC2
can be altered, or new decay modes can be added.

A fit is then performed with \texttt{iminuit}~\cite{Minuit,iminuit}.
It seems reasonable to take the Standard Model Higgs branching ratios
as the starting values of the fit.
Based on a multinomial log-likelihood as its cost function,
a prediction for the branching ratios and the corresponding covariance matrix
are obtained.

The result of this fit is shown in figure~\ref{fig:brs} for
the SM branching ratios and an alternative scenario.
Since the probability vectors of the decay modes are different enough,
the fit moves to the altered branching ratios without any problems.

The uncertainties on the branching ratios can be tested in a toy study.
The uncertainties and correlations of the fit on the expected event counts
are obtained through the second derivatives of the likelihood function
at the fit optimum.
For the toy study, samples are drawn from a Multinomial centered on the
expected counts for each box.
Then, a fit is performed for each of the samples, and the predicted
branching ratio optima are collected.
An example toy study on the $H \to b \bar{b}$ branching ratio is shown in
figure~\ref{fig:toys} (right).
The values from the toy study agree well with those anticipated
from the fit on the expected event counts.

The projected (absolute) $1 \sigma$-uncertainties for the Higgs branching ratios
are listed in table~\ref{tab:br_uncertainties}.
The numbers are based on the simplified scenario
outlined in section~\ref{subsec:simplifications}.

\section{Future work}\label{sec:future_work}
The next iteration of this study has to include the background rates for
Higgs-free events passing the selection.
Then, the proper cross sections and polarizations foreseen at ILC
can be applied.
% It should be tested whether it is better to perform the fit separately
% for the $\mu \mu H$ and $e e H$ samples, or to combine their cost functions
% in a single fit.
% The combined uncertainties should be smaller.
% But it might be more powerful to separately provide
% the two sets of branching ratio measurements
% to a global measurement combination fit with all other Higgs coupling
% measurements from LHC and the Higgs factory.

In the $\nu \nu H$ sample it is necessary to perform a pre-selection based on
the Higgs-part of the event.
Thus, it alone cannot be used for a branching ratio derivation with
an unconditional upper limit on the unobserved branching ratio.
But in combination with the other samples, the larger statistics of this
sample should help decrease the uncertainties.
The $\nu \nu H$ sample should be added to the combined fit,
after choosing a good pre-selection.

The current boxes are far from ideal.
The rest box should be reserved almost exclusively for
background (or unexpected Higgs decay) events.
For some of the Higgs decays, including $H \to W^+ W^-$,
no proper boxes are designed yet.

A mechanism that alerts the analyzer in the case of non-SM Higgs decays
($H \to \mu^+\tau^-, H \to b\bar{c}$, \ldots)
has to be established.
This could be through one or more additional boxes,
or through a comparison of the value of the likelihood at the fit minimum
with the expected value.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
An inclusive measurement of all Higgs branching ratios at once is
an appealing objective.
It can give upper limits for unobserved decays.
The measurements of the individual branching ratios are
connected through the covariance matrix of the fit.
The preliminary results are attractive and motivate
further improvements and an increase of realism in the analysis.
